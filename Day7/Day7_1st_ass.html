                            I didn't mean to create a frog cult.<br>
                            I named the first one Cletus, after a guy my dad used to buy pills from.<br>
                            It felt right. Greasy name.<br>
                            Like something that would survive the apocalypse by crawling into the crawlspace and licking the mold off the copper pipes.<br>
                            Cletus stared at me through the glass like he knew I was broken.<br> 
                            Like he approved.<br>
                            Dumpy tree frog. <br>
                            Litoria caerulea, if you're trying to impress a vet tech. <br>
                            People call them “Dumpy” like that's an insult.<br> 
                            Like their weight's a problem. <br>
                            These frogs don't give a shit. <br>
                            They sag and spread and cling to your window like a melted scoop of pistachio ice cream with eyes.<br>
