        <h1>Origin</h1>
        <p>
            The modern Labrador's ancestors originated on the island of Newfoundland, now part of the<br>
            province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.<br>
            The founding breed of the Labrador was the St. John's water dog, a breed that emerged<br>
            through ad-hoc breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century.<br>
            The forebears of the St. John's Dog are not known, but were likely a random-bred mix of<br>
            English, Irish, and Portuguese working breeds. The Newfoundland (known then as the Greater<br>
            Newfoundland) is likely a result of the St. John's Dog breeding with mastiffs brought to the<br>
            island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the 16th<br>
            century.<br>
            The smaller short-coated St. John's Dog (also known then as the Lesser Newfoundland) was<br>
            used for retrieval and pulling in nets from the water. These smaller dogs were the forebears of<br>
            the Labrador Retriever.<br>
