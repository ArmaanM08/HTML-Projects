        <h1>Appearance around the World</h1>
        <p>
            In the United States, the breed gained wider recognition following a 1928 American Kennel<br>
            Gazette article, "Meet the Labrador Retriever". Before this time, the AKC had only registered 23<br>
            Labradors in the country, in part because US and UK hunting styles had different requirements.<br>
            Labradors acquired popularity as hunting dogs during the 1920s and especially after World War<br>
            II, as they gained recognition as combining some of the best traits of the two favourite United<br>
            States breeds as both game finders and water dogs.<br>
            Outside North America and Western Europe, the Labrador arrived later. For example, the<br>
            Russian Retriever Club traces the arrival of Labradors to the late 1960s, as household pets of<br>
            diplomats and others in the foreign ministry.<br>
            The establishment of the breed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR)<br>
            was initially hindered by the relatively small numbers of Labradors and great distances involved,<br>
            leading to difficulty establishing breedings and bloodlines; at the start of the 1980s, home-born<br>
            dogs were still regularly supplemented by further imports from overseas.<br>
            Difficulties such as these initially led to Labradors being tacitly cross-bred to other types of<br>
            retriever. In the 1990s, improved access to overseas shows and bloodlines is said to have<br>
            helped this situation become regularised.<br>
