        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>
            In 2014, the UK breed survey reported an average lifespan for the Labrador Retriever of 12<br>
            years and 3 months, with some living up to 19 years of age. Labrador pups generally are not<br>
            brought to the home before they are 8 weeks old.<br>
            It is a healthy breed with relatively few major problems. Notable issues related to health and<br>
            well-being include inherited disorders and obesity. A Royal Veterinary College study, and one<br>
            conducted by The University of Sydney, have concluded that Chocolate Labradors have a<br>
            shorter average life expectancy than other colours of Labrador (by about 10%) and are more<br>
            likely to suffer some health problems.<br>
            It is thought that this is due to breeder's attempts to increase their numbers through selective<br>
            coat colour breeding at the expense of other important health traits.<br>
            The brown coat colour is naturally rare (compared to yellow and black), and it has been<br>
            fashionable since the 1980â€™s. This has created a demand for larger numbers.<br>
