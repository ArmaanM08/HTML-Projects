        <h1>Temperament</h1>
        <p>
            Labradors have a reputation as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog.<br>
            This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Some lines,<br>
            particularly those that have continued to be bred specifically for their skills at working in the<br>
            field (rather than for their appearance), are particularly fast and athletic. Their fun-loving<br>
            boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and firm handling at times to ensure it<br>
            does not get out of handâ€”an uncontrolled adult can be quite problematic.<br>
            Females may be slightly more independent than males. Labradors mature at around three years<br>
            of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy, often<br>
            mislabelled as being hyperactive.<br>
            Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when fullgrown.<br>
            Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of<br>
            activity (such as agility, frisbee, or flyball).<br>
